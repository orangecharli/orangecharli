## fancy seeing you here 👋

It's my first time programming, and I'm currently learning Python! I hope to use this to document my learning journey, and hopefully build some cool stuff at the end of it 🌷

### 🍒 some fun facts about me: 
- Drinking coffee to power through the day
- Building giant tree houses on minecraft
- Marking my notion Kanban with lots of emojis 
- Casual enjoyer of drums (not skilled enough to call myself a drummer... yet)
- Loves to drink
